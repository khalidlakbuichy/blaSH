# Minishell

Minishell is a cursus project in the 42 network programming school. The goal of this project is to implement a simple version of a Bash-like shell in C, supporting features such as pipes, redirections, expansions, and command execution.

The project aims to provide a hands-on experience in developing a command-line interpreter, exploring concepts like process management, signal handling, and parsing user input. By building a mini shell, students gain a deeper understanding of how shell programs work under the hood and learn about the intricacies of handling user interactions and executing commands.

## How Minishell Works

Minishell follows a simple yet effective workflow to process user input and execute commands:

1. **Read Line**: The shell prompts the user for input and reads the entered command line.

2. **Parse Input**: The input line is then parsed to identify individual tokens, such as the command name, arguments, and other special characters like pipes, redirections, or expansions.

3. **Execute Command**: After parsing the input, the shell creates the necessary processes and executes the specified command. This may involve setting up pipes, handling redirections, or performing expansions as required.

4. **Repeat**: Once the command execution is complete, the shell returns to the initial state and prompts the user for a new command, repeating the cycle.

This continuous loop of reading input, parsing, executing commands, and repeating allows the shell to provide an interactive command-line interface for users to execute various commands and perform complex operations.

### Parsing

The parsing process in Minishell involves two main stages: lexing and parsing.

#### 1. Lexer

The lexer, or tokenizer, is responsible for breaking down the input command line into a sequence of meaningful tokens. These tokens can represent commands, arguments, operators (such as pipes or redirections), or other special characters.

The lexer scans the input string character by character, applying a set of rules to identify and categorize the different token types. It generates a stream of tokens that serves as input for the parser.

#### 2. Parser

The parser takes the token stream generated by the lexer and constructs an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the command line. The AST is a hierarchical tree-like data structure that captures the relationships between commands, arguments, and operators.

The parser follows a set of grammar rules to analyze the token stream and build the AST. These rules define the valid syntax and semantics of the command line, ensuring that the input is correctly interpreted.

Once the AST is constructed, it can be traversed and processed by the shell to execute the specified commands, handle redirections, set up pipes, and perform any necessary expansions or substitutions.
